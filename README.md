## Introduction
In the dynamic realm of sports analytics, accurate predictions remains paramount. Leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVMs), offers a promising route to decode the intricate patterns underlying game outcomes. This project embarks on a journey into the 2023 Women's NCAA DI-DIII Lacrosse season, delving deep into how SVMs, renowned for their geometric prowess, illuminate the trajectory of matches with remarkable precision.

SVMs stand dominant amongst geometric-based machine learning tools, known for their ability to discern complex decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces. Their application in sports analytics holds immense potential, especially in the context of lacrosse, a sport characterized by nuanced interactions between offensive prowess and defensive resilience.

Against this backdrop, this project ventures into the realm of real-time statistics from the 2023 Women's NCAA Lacrosse season, wielding SVMs as a lens to unravel the underlying dynamics driving game outcomes. With a keen focus on both offensive and defensive metrics, the analysis undertaken herein aims to transcend mere prediction, offering invaluable insights into the fundamental factors shaping victories and defeats on the lacrosse field.

Through meticulous examination and rigorous analysis, this project illuminates the efficacy of SVMs in classifying game results, distinguishing between triumphs and setbacks with a remarkable accuracy rate. By dissecting the intricate interplay of statistical indicators, it unveils the hidden patterns that dictate success in the realm of women's collegiate lacrosse.

In essence, this project serves as a testament to the transformative potential of advanced machine learning techniques in the realm of sports analytics. By unraveling the mysteries of game outcomes through the lens of SVMs, it not only enhances our predictive capabilities but also deepens our understanding of the multifaceted dynamics inherent in one of the most captivating sports arenas.

Through this exploration, we embark on a journey to uncover the predictive power of SVMs in the exhilarating domain of women's NCAA lacrosse, paving the way for novel insights and breakthroughs in sports analytics.
 
## Objective 
To create a Support Vector Machine model capable of accurately classifying a given game as a win or loss using statistics about the team up until that point in the season. By leveraging real-time statistics from the 2023 season, I intend to train the SVM model to analyze both offensive and defensive metrics and make informed predictions about game outcomes. Through this analysis, I aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of SVMs in providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making in collegiate lacrosse.

## Data
